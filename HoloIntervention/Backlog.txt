Major implementation details remaining:

*Network search on startup
Volume rendering
Registration drift
Registration restart, stop, start
Network connect, disconnect, connect, connection lost
*Log system bug
Voice feedback
UI for IP setting - Dictation*
Registration feedback (move around, etc...)
*Stabilization system, priorities based on objects in view or not (frustum check done anyways, record it)
